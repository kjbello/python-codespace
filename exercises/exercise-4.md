# Exercise 4 - Upgrade the Cars API to use a Cars Sql Data service

1. Review the Colors Sql Data service code. In particular, review the file structure, dependency injection, and the Annotated type.

2. Create a new Cars Sql Data service following the Colors Sql Data pattern. Copy and paste is fine, but please review the code.

3. Update the Cars API to run `uvicorn` within the `main.py` file.

4. Run the service and validate it with Swagger and a Python program.
