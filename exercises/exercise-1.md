# Exercise 1 - Create a Cars API

1. Create a new folder named `cars_api` in the `demos` folder. Create a new file named `main.py` folder. This will be the starting point of the FastAPI REST application.

2. Define a Car Model using a Typed Dictionary or Data Class. It should have the following fields:

    - id: int
    - make: str
    - model: str
    - year: int
    - color: str
    - price: float

3. Define a Car Schema. Follow the pattern from the Colors API and the Car Model above.

4. Add an endpoint to return all Cars (create a list of two cars). Test the endpoint with the web browser or the VS Code REST extension.

5. Write a small Python client program to call the endpoint and display the cars in the console.
