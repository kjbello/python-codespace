# Exercise 2 - Add a Create Car Endpoint

1. Following the example of the Colors API, create an endpoint for creating a car. Set the `id` of the new car to 1. Return a Car object with the fields populated. Within the endpoint function, print the car to the console just as the Colors API does. We will write code to add the car to a data store later.

2. Verify the call to the create endpoint using Python code and the VS Code Extension (if you are using it). The Car object returned by the Cars create endpoint should have the `id` property populated with 1.
